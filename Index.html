    <h1>What is C</h1>
    <p>Its an imperative procedural language. All the code has to be inside a function. C files are the source code of your program.
        You have to compile the C files with a compiler like gcc to make an executable file.
    </p>
    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p>In C we use /* and end with */</p>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>Here we have data types and integer types which are the following and each has a storage size it takes</p>
    <ul>
        <li>char.....1byte...(-128 to 127)</li>
        <li>unsigned char....1byte....(0 to 255)</li>
        <li>short.....2bytes....(-32768 to 32767)</li>
        <li>unsigned short .....2bytes......(0 to 65535)</li>
        <li>int....4bytes....(-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)</li>
        <li>unsigned int...4bytes......(0 to 4,294,967,295)</li>
        <li>long....8bytes....(âˆ’9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)</li>
        <li>unsigned long....8bytes.....(0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Variables have a Declaration too like for example ....type var_name;  or ...int i;.....or char c;</p>
    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p>An array is a succession of items of the same type in memory...example I can say ......
     int my_array[35]....or ...char my_array_arrays[16][32]</p>
     <h2>Structures</h2>
     <p>This is a complex data type declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables to be placed under one name in 
        a block memory......creation and declarion is as follows...
        <br>
        <br>
        struct structure_name{
            type name;
            [...] 
        };
        struct structure_name var_name;
        <br>
        <br>
        struct new_struct{
            int a;
            char b[32];
        }
        struct new_struct s;
     </p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h1>Functions, Programs</h1>
     <p>A program is a collection of functions. A function is a sequence of program instructions that perform a specific task 
        The syntax is as follows..
        <br>
        return_type function_name(type param, type2 param2 [...])
        [block]
        <br>
        example
        <br>
        int func(int a, char c)
        [block]
     </p>
     <br>
     <h2>The Entry Point</h2>
     <p>Note that programs begin with an entry point.....In C the entry point is main function. From the main function you can call 
        all other functions. When the main returns the program stops. ...
        <em>int main(void)......int main(int ac, char **av)</em>
     </p>
     <h2>Blocks</h2>
     <p>They are sections of codes that are grouped together. They are delimited  by curly braces.....syntax 
        <br>
        {
            [declaration(s)]

            [statements(s)]
        }
        <br>
        example
        <br>
        int func(int a, int b)
        {
            /* declarations */
            int mul; 
            int sum;
            int result;

            /* statements */
            mul = a * b;
            sum = a + b;
            result = mul + sum;
            return(result);
        }
     </p>
     <br>
     <h1>Instructions and Expressions</h1>
     <p>Expression followed by a semicolon indicates the end of one logical entity...They always have a value
        Types of expressions are......Basic expressions(arithmetic opertaions)....Affectations(assigning a value to a variable)
        ......Comparisons(checking the equality of values).....Logical Operations(checking whether tow things are the same).....
        Binary Opertaions.
     </p>
     <br>
     <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>They are inside single quotes. The value of a character is its ASCII code(man ascii)</p>
    <h2>Strings</h2>
    <p>They are inside double quotes</p>
    <h2>Affectations</h2>
    <p>Their syntax as follows....... var_array[expressions] = expression;
                              ....... var_struct.field_name = expression;
    </p>
    <h2>Variable assignment  | example</h2>
    <p>
        int add(int a, int b, int c)
        {
            int result;

            result a +  b + c;
            [...]
        }
        int main()
        {
            int a;
            int b;
            
            b = 98;
            a = 1 + 2 + 3 * 4 - 1;
            b = 23 +add(32, a, a + b);
            [...]
        }
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Control Structures</h1>
    <p>Here we have .....if.... and if else statements.... </p>
    <h3>while loops</h3>
    <p>syntax.....
        while(expression)
          [block]
          <br>
       While loop lets you repeat a block until a specified expression becomes false.
       <br>
       <br>
       int array_var[98];
       int i;
       
       i = 0;
       while (i < 98)
       {
          array_var[i] = 1337;
          i++;
       }
    </p>
    <h3>for loops</h3>
    <p>This one lets you repeat a block a specified number of times. Its executed until the optional condition becomes false.
         The syntax is as follows.....for(initialize; condition; update)
                                          [block]
        example
        <br>
        int array_var(98);
        int i;
        
        for(i = 0; i < 98; i++)
        {
            array_var[i] = 1337;
        }
    </p>

    <h1>Keywords and Identifiers</h1>
    <h2>Keywords</h2>
    <p>Some of the keywords in C programmng include the following......auto, break, if, while, int, else, struct, long, float, 
        static, char, register, return, signed, sizeof, goto, void, unsigned, enum, typedef, switch and many more. The new ones are 
        volatile, const, void and signed.
    </p>
    <h2>Identifiers</h2>
    <p>Its a fancy term used to mean name in C. The only restriction is that an identifier must start with an alphabetic character</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Intergral Types.</h1>
    <p>We start by looking at various types of integers then their conversion rules.</p>
    <h2>Plain Integers</h2>
    <p>The most obvious one is <em>signed int</em> and the less obvious one is <em>unsigned int</em>.</p>
    <h2>Character Variables</h2>
    <p>This is simply the char. A char is just an integer.....Example of char is as below..........
        <br>
        <br>

        include <limits.h>
        include <stdio.h>  
        include <stdlib.h> 
         
        main(){
            char c;

            c = CHAR_MIN;
            while(c != CHAR_MIN){
                print("%d\n", c);
                c = c+1;
            }
              exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); 
        }    
    </p>
    <p>Its useful to be able to read characters in a program.The library function <em>getchar</em> is used for the job ....It 
    reads characters in a program and returns an int value which is stored in the char.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
         <h1>More Complicated Types</h1>
         <p>For serious systems programming they are just aren't adequete in the precision of control over storage that 
            they provide and behaviour that they follow. To correct this problem C provides extra Intergral types. They are 
            split into two categories ..... <em>signed and unsigned</em>. Signed are capable of being negative while unsigned
            cannot be negative at any time. unsigned also have a special character of not overflowing in arithmetic.
            <br>
            <br>
            #include <stdio.h>
                #include <stdlib.h>
                main(){
                      unsigned int x;
                      x = 0;
                      while(x >= 0){
                              printf("%u\n", x);
                              x = x+1;
                      }
                
                      exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
                }
                <br>
                <br>
            For both signed and unsigned we have three subtypes, <em>short, ordinary and long.</em> Taking those into account, here is a 
            list of possible Intergral types in C....
            <ul>
                <li><em>unsigned short int</em></li>
                <li><em>unsigned int</em></li>
                <li><em>unsigned long int</em></li>
                <li><em>signed short int</em></li>
                <li><em>signed int</em></li>
                <li><em>signed long int</em></li>
            </ul>  
            <br>
            The last three signed are unnecessary since int types are signed types anyway. The only character types are signed
            and unsigned.  
         </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Printing Intergral Types</h1>
    <p>You can use printf to print these various types. Character variables work exactly the same way as Intergral variables. 
        ......%c for char.....%d for decimal signed int, short and char..............%u for decimal unsigned int, short and char......
        ..%x for hexadecimal int, short and char .........%o for octo int, short and char.......%ld for decimal signed long......
        ....%lu %lx & %lo for as aboves but for longs
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>If Statements in C</h1>
    <p>Without a conditional staement such as if statements ....programs would run almost the same way every time. Lets check the difference 
        between TRUE and FALSE. A TRUE statement equal to a nonzero number while a FALSE statements equla to zero. The operator returns 1 if
        the condition is true and returns 0 is the condition is false.
    </p>
    <h3>Basic if statements</h3>
    <p>
        if(the statement is true)
         Execute this line of code
    </p>
